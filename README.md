## 1. Introduction
This project focuses on securing point cloud-based object detection systems, particularly those used in autonomous vehicles. The research investigates the vulnerabilities of these systems to intensity-based adversarial attacks, where the intensity values of points in 3D point clouds are manipulated to mislead detection models.
